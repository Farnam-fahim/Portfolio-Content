About me
Hello, everyone. I am Farnam an Iranian guy who is mostly in love with foods. I also love playing video games and
I take them very seriously cause I play competetively; although I have not won any prize but I am trying my best.


So basically my life started when I went to live in another country "Malaysia" when I was 11 years old.I lived their
for 3 years and then return back to my home country to continue my study, so I can pursue my goals and go to the country
that I really love as a successful person, which was Canada. After I got graduated from high school I applied for SFU,
one of the best uiversities in Canada, as Engineer. I got my aceptance and successfully came to Vancouver, Canada.

In this time that I was studying Engineering I had to make one of the hardest decisions in my life. I was stuck in
a dilemma of being an Engineer or a Programmer. After researching for month I made my decision and chose to be a Programmer.
So I transfered to ITD college which IT is one of their specialities. This was the time that I understood that my love is not 
only for foods and games but also programming; because I always wanted to know how do people creat these joyful games.However
making games has a different field of study but the concept is hidden in heart of ptogramming.
